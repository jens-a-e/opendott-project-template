abstract: |
  Compiling research output comprised of different kinds of authoring types such as source code, slideshows, images, long form texts, etc. is challenging to bring together and keep up to date in a reproducable form. The scripting efforts in this repository attempt to support this in an effort to foster plaintext based research and avoid heavy formats such as MS Word doduments as storage.
